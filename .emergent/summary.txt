The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the project by creating a mobile-responsive frontend prototype, prioritizing an aha moment with mock data as per the . The initial build included a simulated map, worker points, a search button, and basic radius display with notifications. Upon user feedback, the engineer iteratively refined the frontend, addressing a critical centering issue for the search radius and implementing complex visual enhancements. This involved adding a 2-second loading delay, a progress bar, a wave effect, and a series of sequential animations for worker discovery and result presentation. The focus remained strictly on frontend aesthetics and interactivity, fulfilling the user's explicit request to maximize visual appeal and defer backend development. The work demonstrates strong adherence to mobile-first design, color guidelines, and animation requirements, culminating in a highly polished and engaging demo prototype.

<product_requirements>
The core product requirement is to create a mobile-responsive web interface simulating a worker search application. The goal is to provide an interactive prototype for demonstrations without a real backend or database.

**Key Features Requested & Implemented:**
*   **Simplified Map Interface:** A central area representing a map, initially a white rectangle, now styled with a subtle grid pattern.
*   **User Position:** A fixed central point (dark blue/purple) representing the user, now with a pulsing animation.
*   **Worker Display:** Green points representing workers, initially 10, dispersed around the map with simulated coordinates and detailed information.
*   **Rechercher autour de moi Button:** A prominent button to trigger the search.
*   **Search Radius:** Upon clicking search, a circle (e.g., 100px or 5km equivalent) appears around the user.
*   **Worker Visibility/Style Change:** Workers within the radius become visible or change style, now with a badge ðŸ“¬, blinking, pulsing, and point enlargement.
*   **Loading and Animation:** A 2-second delay during search, an animated loading overlay with a spinner, a progress bar, and a wave effect on the search circle.
*   **Sequential Visual Enhancements:** Animations for revealing workers (rotation, enlargement), sliding in result cards, a success ring around found workers, and enhanced blinking notifications.
*   **Overall UI/UX:** Sober style, blue (#2233aa) and white dominant colors, light green for workers, rounded corners, large buttons suitable for mobile, fluid and professional animations, improved hover effects with 3D transforms, and longer transitions. The UI displays found workers with profiles, specialties, notes, and distances.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React.js:** Frontend framework for building the UI.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework used for styling and responsiveness.
-   **CSS Animations:** Extensive use of CSS for interactive elements, transitions, keyframes, and sequential animations.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla/React State):** Managing UI interactions, mock data, and dynamic content rendering.
-   **Mock Data:** Simulation of backend data for frontend development without a real database.
-   **:** Used for precise centering of UI elements.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, although only the frontend is currently implemented.

**Detailed Directory Structure (Inferred and Initial Context):**

craco start

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main entry point for the React application, setting up routing with . It currently includes a basic  component that attempts a  call, but this is currently boilerplate and not used by the core worker search logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial boilerplate provided. The main application logic has been developed in  and imported here or within a new route/component (details not fully provided in trajectory but implied by  creation).

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global CSS styles, including basic app-wide styles and animations like .
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes detailed in the trajectory, but it would be influenced by the  and  for overall styling.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities. Defines CSS variables for color themes (light/dark mode) used by Tailwind.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes specified, serves as the foundation for Tailwind styling.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, extending default themes with custom colors, border radii, and keyframes (e.g., for accordion animations).
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes detailed, but likely configured to support the custom blue/white/green color palette.

-   ** (New file)**:
    -   **Summary**: This is the central component where the worker search prototype logic and UI are implemented. It contains the simulated map, user point, worker points, search button, radius display, loading animations, and result cards.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was created and iteratively refined. Initial implementation included the core map and worker display. Subsequent edits focused on:
        *   Correctly centering the search circle using .
        *   Adding a 2-second search delay.
        *   Implementing a loading overlay with a spinner.
        *   Integrating a progress bar.
        *   Adding a wave effect to the search circle during loading.
        *   Developing sequential animations for worker revelation (rotation, enlargement).
        *   Implementing animated sliding for result cards.
        *   Adding expanding success rings around found workers.
        *   Enhancing notification badges with pulsing and blinking effects.
        *   Styling worker points with golden borders and profile cards with gradients/shadows.
        *   Managing button disable states and applying advanced hover effects (3D transforms) and longer CSS transitions.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Provides a custom React hook for displaying toasts/notifications within the application.

<current_work>
Currently, a fully functional and highly aesthetic mobile-responsive frontend prototype for a worker search application has been developed. This prototype operates entirely with mock data to simulate a complete application experience for demonstration purposes.

The application features:
*   A stylized map area,
*   A central pulsing user point,
*   Multiple green worker points scattered around.
*   A prominent Rechercher autour de moi button.

Upon clicking the search button, the application now executes a sophisticated animation sequence:
1.  A loading overlay with a spinner appears, accompanied by a 2-second delay.
2.  A progress bar fills gradually.
3.  A search circle expands around the user point with a wave effect.
4.  Workers within the simulated 5km radius are identified and visually highlighted.
5.  Found workers are revealed with rotation and enlargement animations.
6.  An expanding success ring propagates around each found worker.
7.  Detailed profile cards for found workers slide up sequentially from the bottom.
8.  Red ðŸ“¬ badges appear on found workers, pulsing and blinking for notification.
9.  Worker points themselves are larger with golden borders, and Disponible status indicators blink.
10. All interactive elements feature smooth 0.4s transitions and enhanced 3D hover effects. The search button is disabled during the search process.

The prototype is in a highly polished state, perfectly demonstrating the concept's visual appeal and interactive flow without any real backend integration.
